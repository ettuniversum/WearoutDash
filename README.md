# WearoutDash

Minimal viable product (mvp) hardware and software solution for over-the-ear wearable heart rate monitor. Over-the-ear sensor placement is a cost effective and high-precision device to measure the effects of bloodflow to the head.

Wearout dashboard utilizes a open-source PulseSensor arduino sensor, open-source PPG analysis toolkit (heartpy), and open-source Dash and Plotly library for the dashboard.
